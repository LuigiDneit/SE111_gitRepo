            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>The movie Hellraiser while it does come out during the height of the slasher craze of horror, it takes a different approach in how it does horror compared to those movies. Instead of just seeing a strong killer maiming defenseless teens, Hellraiser shows normal humans doing disturbing and depraved acts as a means to further their selfish goals.</p>
            <p>My favorite part of the movie has to be the main villian, Frank Cotten, which may sound weird seeing as theres a pale demon on the movie poster to say some regular guy being the main villian seems off, but I can assure you the writing of the story does it justice.</p>
            <p>My biggest gripe with the movie is how little we get to see the supernatural forces of the Cenobites, for what we do see of them they are very interesting characters and would be amazing to learn more about them but we only get to see them for about 5 minutes total, once when they first appear and later for the final confrontation.</p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hellraiser is based off of the book written by Clive Barker named "The Hellbound Heart"</li>
                <li>At the end of the movie during Frank's second meetup with the Cenobites, originally Frank's line was just meant to be "Fuck you" but Larry's actor, Andrew Robinson, convinced Clive to change the line to the now iconic "Jesus wept"</li>
                <li>It took around 6 hours to apply the makeup for the main Cenobite, Pinhead, to Doug Bradely everytime they needed to shoot a scene with him. He ended up picking up skills at makeup from these sessions and was credited as an assistant makeup artist in the credits</li>
            </ul>
